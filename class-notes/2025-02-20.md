## Oil Lubrication Service and Repair Fundamentals

American Petroleum Institute = "API"
Motor oils are petroleum hydrocarbon compounds:
- Can flow easily through the engine
- Provide lubrication without foaming
- Reduces friction and wear
- Prevents the formation of rust and corrosion
- Cools the engine parts it flows over
- Keeps internal engine parts clean

Viscosity ratings: 5w30
- Low viscosity (thin) oils have low numbers
- High viscosity (thick) oils have high numbers
- The "w" stands for winter and has been tested for cold weather


Antioxidants keeps oil stable at high temperatures (prevents varnish and carbon deposits).


Positive Crank Ventilation (PCV) - recirculates blow-by from the engine back into the intake so that it can be burned in the engine.


Oil film lubricates small space between moving parts, about 0.002" (0.05mm)

The oil pump delivers 20-30 psi at idle; 40-60 pst at crusing and high speeds.
