## Ignition, Fuel, Intake, and Exhaust Systems

Minimum voltage requirement to jump the plug gap is 10,000 volts
Must maintain the spark long enough to allow for complete combustion.
It must deliver the spark so combusion can being at the precise time.

Coil pack (coil ignition) creates the magnetic winding to create a high voltage/secondary winding (from the battery 12 volts to 10,000 volts).
If the spark plug does not get a spark, the problem is the coil pack.

## Spark Plugs

Provides the air gap.
Resistor reduces FRI.
Standard plug electrodes are copper.
Platinum electrodes extend plug life.
Replace at 60,000 to 100,000 miles.

## Plug Wires

The plug wires carry the current from the coil pack and distributor to the the spark plug.

## Fuel System

14.7:1 mixture (air:fuel)
