## Tire Diagnosis

## Tire Ware and failure

When tires wear in any location down to 2/32, or if they have a wear bar and the tread is flush with the wear bar, replacement is needed. Tire tread is needed all over the tire for different road situations.

## Tread Wear Characteristics

Tire Bulge: the cause of the tire bulge can be either from a heavy stress to the tire sidewall, like bouncing your tire off or up a curb at a good speed, or manufacturing defect with the tire sidewall being weak form the factory, or both.

## Tire Construction

Tires are made of rubber, steel, and fabric. The rubber provides traction and durability, the steel provides strength and support, and the fabric provides flexibility and comfort.

## Tire Tread Styles

Asymmetrical Tread: The tread pattern is different on the inside and outside of the tire. This type of tire is designed to provide better handling and stability.
Symmetrical Tread: The tread pattern is the same on both sides of the tire. This type of tire is designed to provide better traction and wear.
Directional Tread: The tread pattern is designed to channel water away from the tire. This type of tire is designed to provide better traction in wet conditions.
Non-Directional Tread: The tread pattern is not designed to channel water away from the tire. This type of tire is designed to provide better traction in dry conditions.

## Run Flat Tires

Vehicle with run-flat tires do not have a spare tire or jack.

Three categories of run-flat tires:

- Self-sealing
- Self-supporting
- Auxiliary supported systems

## OEM Tire Decal

Can be found on the driver's door jamb or inside the glove box. It provides information about the recommended tire size, load rating, and inflation pressure for the vehicle. This information is important for maintaining proper tire performance and safety.

## Tire Ratings

Tire Types:

- P: Passenger
- LT: Light Truck
- T: Temporary
- C: Commercial

Section Width: The width of the tire in millimeters. For example, a tire with a section width of 225 is 225 mm wide.

Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the tire's height to its width. For example, a tire with an aspect ratio of 60 has a height that is 60% of its width.

Construction Type:

- R: Radial
- D: Diagonal (Bias)
- B: Bias Belted

Rim Diameter: The diameter of the wheel in inches. For example, a tire with a rim diameter of 16 is designed to fit a 16-inch wheel.

Speed Rating: The maximum speed at which the tire can safely operate. For example, a tire with a speed rating of 89 can safely operate at speeds up to 130 mph.

Load Index: The maximum load that the tire can safely carry. For example, a tire with a load index of H can safely carry a load of 1,100 lbs.

## UTQG and DOT Code

The UTQG (Uniform Tire Quality Grading) code is a standardized system used to rate the performance of tires in three categories: treadwear, traction, and temperature resistance. The DOT (Department of Transportation) code is a unique identifier assigned to each tire that provides information about the tire's manufacturer, production date, and other important details.

## Tire Pressure

Proper tire pressure is important for safety, fuel efficiency, and tire longevity. Under-inflated tires can cause poor handling, increased tire wear, and reduced fuel efficiency. Over-inflated tires can cause a harsh ride and increased risk of tire failure.

## Tightening Sequence

When tightening lug nuts, always follow the manufacturer's recommended tightening sequence. This is typically a star pattern, which helps ensure even pressure on the wheel and prevents warping or damage to the brake rotor.

## Tire Rotation

Tire rotation is the practice of moving tires from one position on the vehicle to another. This helps ensure even tire wear and prolongs the life of the tires. The recommended tire rotation pattern varies depending on the type of vehicle and tire configuration.

Tire rotation patterns include:

- Front-to-back: Moving the front tires to the back and the back tires to the front.
- Cross: Moving the front tires to the opposite sides of the back and the back tires to the opposite sides of the front.
- Side-to-side: Moving the tires on one side of the vehicle to the other side.
- Rearward: Moving the rear tires to the front and the front tires to the back.
- Forward: Moving the front tires to the back and the back tires to the front.
- X-pattern: Moving the front tires to the opposite sides of the back and the back tires to the opposite sides of the front, but with a twist.

Tire rotation is typically recommended every 5,000 to 7,500 miles, but this can vary depending on the vehicle and tire type.

## TPM

Standard on all 2007 and newer passenger vehiles 10,000 pounds or less.
Must illuminate a warning light if pressure is 25% below recommeneded cold pressure.
Two systems used:

- Direct: Uses a sensor mounted inside the tire to measure pressure and transmit the information to the vehicle's computer.
- Indirect: Uses the vehicle's ABS system to monitor wheel speed and detect changes in tire pressure based on differences in wheel speed.

## Tire Balancing

Tire balancing is the process of ensuring that the weight of the tire and wheel assembly is evenly distributed. This helps prevent vibrations and uneven tire wear. Balancing is typically done using a balancing machine that spins the tire and wheel assembly to identify any imbalances.

Static Balancing: Involves adding weights to the wheel to balance it in a stationary position. This is typically done on the inside and outside of the wheel.
Dynamic Balancing: Involves adding weights to the wheel to balance it while it is in motion. This is typically done on the inside and outside of the wheel, as well as on the rim.

## Tire Wear Patterns

Tire wear patterns can provide valuable information about the condition of the vehicle's suspension and alignment. Common tire wear patterns include:

- Wear Indicators: Raised rubber bars that are molded into the tire tread. When the tread wears down to the level of the wear indicators, it is time to replace the tire.
- Overinflation: Causes the center of the tire tread to wear faster than the edges. This can be caused by overinflating the tire or driving on rough roads.
- Underinflation: Causes the edges of the tire tread to wear faster than the center. This can be caused by underinflating the tire or driving on smooth roads.
- Camber Wear: Causes the inside or outside edge of the tire tread to wear faster than the rest of the tire. This can be caused by improper alignment or suspension issues.
- Feather Wear: Causes the tread to wear unevenly, with one side of the tread being more worn than the other. This can be caused by improper alignment or suspension issues.
- Spotty/Chopped Wear: Causes the tread to wear unevenly, with small patches of wear on the tire. This can be caused by improper alignment or suspension issues.
- Diagnol Wear: Causes the tread to wear unevenly, with a diagonal pattern of wear on the tire. This can be caused by improper alignment or suspension issues.
- Local Wear: Causes the tread to wear unevenly, with a localized area of wear on the tire. This can be caused by improper alignment or suspension issues.
