## Drum Brakes

Drum brakes are a type of brake system that uses a drum and shoes to create friction and slow down the vehicle.
Some drums have cooling fins cast into the outer circumference to increase the cooling area of the drum.

## Brake Shoes

Brake shoes are the components that press against the inside of the drum to create friction and slow down the vehicle.
They are typically made from a friction material that is bonded to a metal backing plate.

Lining may be bonded to the shoe or riveted to the shoe.
Bonded linings are typically used on newer vehicles, while riveted linings are more common on older vehicles.
Riveted linings are more durable and can be replaced without having to replace the entire shoe.

Bonded can go down to 4mm, while riveted can go down to 2 mm.

## Brake Shoe Backing Plate

There are six support pads on the backing plate that the brake shoes rest against.
The backing plate holds the complete brake assembly.
The shoes slide across the lubricated shoe contract support pads as they are applied and released. (lubricate support pads to reduce noise and aid movement)

## Wheel Cylinder Components

The dust boot keeps dirt and moisture out of the cylinder.
Dust boots also keep minor fluid seepage from getting onto the brake lining.

## Self Adjusters

Self adjusters adjust as brake linings wear. Brake adjustment compensates for lining wear and maintains correct cearance between the lining and drum.
Without self adjusters wheel cylinders must move farther increasing pedal travel.
Self adjusters use the movement of brake shoes to operate.

## Drm Brake Design

Leading-trailing brakes (also called partial-servo or non-servo) brake shoes are the same length. The applying force is provided by the wheel cylinder.
The anchor pin is located at the bottom of the brake assembly and create equal pressure at both sides. There is a leading shoe and trailing shoe.

Duo-servo brakes (also called dual-servo or full-servo) the primary shoe is smaller than the secondary shoe (and is usually longer). The primary shoe is the shoe facing the front of the vehicle.
The achor pin is located at the top of the brake assembly and creates unequal pressure at both sides and creates more pressure on the secondary shoe.
The leading shoe is the shoe facing the front of the vehicle.
The secondary shoe is the shoe facing the rear of the vehicle.

## Drum Removal

Make sure the parking brake is off, if the drum is dished and won't come off, loosen the parking brake cable to ensure enough show clearance for drum removal.

## Drum Breake Cleaning Methods

+ Vacuum-enclosure cleaning system
+ Wet-cleaning systems
+ Parks washers

Wear a mask and goggles when using a cleaning system that uses solvents.
Do not use compressed air to clean brake drums or shoes. Compressed air can create dust that can be harmful to your health.
Do not use a wire brush to clean brake drums or shoes. A wire brush can damage the surface of the drum or shoe and create dust that can be harmful to your health.

## Lining Inspection

Linings should be inspected for:

+ Unequal ware
+ Thickness
+ Cracks
+ Fluid or grease contamination
+ Other damage

If it's grease, it's the bearings
If it's brake fluid, it's the wheel cylinder
If it's differntual fluid, it's the axle seal

## Wheel Cylinders

Install wheel cylinder clamps or zip ties to the cylinder to keep the pistons from popping out when rear brakes are disassembled.

## Drum Conditions

Drums with hard spots should be replaced
Heat checks may have bluish gold tint and can be resurfaced
Any cracks on the drum web no matter what size must be replaced

Most rotors are going to last 100,000 miles.

## Discard Diameter

The discard diameter is cast or stamped onto every brake drum made since the early 1970s. If the drum is worn beyond this diameter, it must be replaced.
The discard diameter is the minimum diameter that the drum can be machined to before it becomes unsafe to use.

## Drum out of round

An out of round drum will have unequal diameter measurements.
An out of round drum can cause vibration and noise when the brakes are applied.

## Drum Machining

Install a viration damper to keep the drum from chattering while being refinished.
