# May 15, 2025 - Prep for Final

The final will have a few things about engines, and everything after the mid-term (battery, electrical).

Open circut is 12.6 volts.
Six cells and each one is 2.1 volts
Fuse should never be bigger than what it was before.
Low volts is 12.6-13ish
High voltage is 10,000 amps

MAF checks how much volume of air is coming into the engine.
If there is too much air, it's running lean.
More fuel is running rich.

When the car is in idle, the Idle Air Bypass allows air to continue to flow to the engine.

Go over all notes from 4/5 to 5/8.
