# April 24, 2025 - Steering and Suspension Systems

## Parallelogram Steering Linkage and Components

- **Pitman Arm**: Connects the linkage to the steering gear.
- **Idler Arm**: Supports the center link to the frame.
- **Center Link, Drag Link, or Steering Link**: Controls sideways linkage movement.
- **Tie Rods**: Connect linkage to the steering knuckles.

## Rack and Pinion Steering

- **Rack**: Is a toothed bar in a metal housing that acts similar to a center link.
- **Pinion**: Is a worm gear attached to the steering column that transfers movement to the rack.
- **Tie-Rods**: Connect the rack to the steering knuckles.

## Power Steering Pumps

If the steering wheel is hard to turn in both directions, the problem is likely in the power steering pump. If the steering wheel is hard to turn in one direction, the problem is likely in the steering gear or linkage.

The power steering pump is a hydraulic pump that provides the necessary pressure to assist in steering. It is typically driven by a belt connected to the engine.

## Power Steering Hoses

Transmit fluid from the pump to the grearbox and back to the pump.
Must handle pressures up to 1500 psi.
Subject to pressure and pulsations from the pump.
Must be able to withstand temperatures up to 300Â°F.

To find a leak, turn the steering wheel all the way to the left and lock it, run the egine at 2,000 RPM for a few minutes. You'll be able to see the leak if there is one. If you can't find a leak, check the fluid level in the reservoir. If it's low, add fluid and check for leaks again. If the fluid level is normal, check the hoses for cracks or bulges. If you find any, replace the hose.

## Suspensions

There are two types of suspensions: independent and dependent.

- **Independent Suspension**: Each wheel is supported by its own suspension system. This allows for better handling and ride comfort.
- **Dependent Suspension**: The wheels are connected by a solid axle. This type of suspension is typically found on trucks and SUVs.

## SLA - Short Long Arm Suspension

- **Upper Control Arm**: Shorter than the lower control arm.
- **Lower Control Arm**: Longer than the upper control arm.

If it has a frame (not a unibody), the vehicle will have an SLA suspension.

## MacPherson Strut Suspension

- **Strut Assembly**: Contains the spring and shock absorber in one unit.

If it has a unibody, the vehicle will have a MacPherson strut suspension.

## Sway Bars

Are used to reduce body roll during cornering. They are typically connected to the lower control arms and the frame.
When the vehicle turns, the sway bar twists, transferring weight from one side of the vehicle to the other. This helps keep the vehicle level and improves handling.

## Caster Alignment

- **Caster**: The angle of the steering axis of a wheel from the vertical, as viewed from the side of the vehicle. Provides steering stability. Not related to tire wear. Affected by worn ball joins, strut rods, and control arm bushings. Only in the front tires.

## Camber Alignment

- **Camber**: The angle represented by the tilt of either the front or rear wheels inware or outward from the vertical, as viewed from the front of the care. Can cuase tire wear and pull to the most postivie side. Affected by sprints, ball joints, control arm bushings, and wheel bearings.

## Toe Alignment

- **Toe**: The distance comparison between the leading edge and trailing edge of the front tires. Can create tire wear. Must bbe adjusted evenly on each side. Incorrect toe can cause the steering wheel to be off-center.
