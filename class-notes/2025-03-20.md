Mid-term will be available on Canvas this Saturday (March, 22).

Thermostat regulates the tempurature, allows for more coolant to pass to keep the vehicle running between 180-220 degrees.
The thermostat opens 20 degrees before it's rating.
Engine will run hotter without a thermostat
Coolant tempurature sensor tells the ECM/ECU to start cooling the engine again.

Two types of fans: clutch fan and electrical fan

Camshafts are located: overhead cam (over the valves) and overhead valve

720 degrees of rotation for a complete cycle of the engine (intake, compression, power, exhaust)

Displacement is measured in liters or cubic inches (CID)
Displacement is the volume of air/fuel mixture that is drawn into the cylinders during the intake stroke.
Displacement is calculated by multiplying the bore (diameter of the cylinder) by the stroke (distance the piston travels up and down in the cylinder) and then multiplying that by the number of cylinders.
Displacement is important because it determines the amount of power an engine can produce.

Both valves are closed during the compression stroke, which allows for the air/fuel mixture to be compressed before ignition.

Alternator is part of the primary (low voltage) circuit, while the starter is part of the secondary (high voltage) circuit.
The alternator is responsible for charging the battery and powering the electrical systems of the vehicle while the engine is running.

Spark wires are part of the secondary (high voltage) circuit, while the ignition coil is part of the primary (low voltage) circuit.

The idle air control (IAC) valve is responsible for controlling the amount of air that bypasses the throttle plate when the engine is idling. It helps to maintain a stable idle speed by adjusting the amount of air entering the engine.

If the spark plug's ceramic insulator is cracked, it can cause misfires and poor engine performance. It can also allow combustion gases to escape, which can lead to overheating and damage to the engine.

What type of additive keep oils stable at high temperatures? Antioxidants are used to keep oils stable at high temperatures. They help to prevent oxidation and breakdown of the oil, which can lead to sludge formation and reduced lubrication properties.

Synthetic oils are made from chemically modified petroleum components, while conventional oils are derived from crude oil. Synthetic oils offer better performance in extreme temperatures and provide better protection against wear and deposits.

Friction reducing additives are used to reduce friction between moving parts in the engine, which can help to improve fuel efficiency and reduce wear on engine components. Examples include molybdenum disulfide and graphite.

Blue exhause means oil is burning, which can indicate worn piston rings or valve seals. It can also be caused by a malfunctioning PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) system.

Cranckshaft bearings are located between the crankshaft and the engine block, providing a smooth surface for the crankshaft to rotate on. They help to reduce friction and wear on the crankshaft, allowing it to rotate freely.
The oil pump is responsible for circulating oil throughout the engine to lubricate moving parts and reduce friction. It is typically driven by the crankshaft and can be either a gear or rotor type pump.

The "W" in oil viscosity ratings (e.g., 10W-30) stands for "winter" and indicates the oil's viscosity at low temperatures. The number before the "W" represents the oil's viscosity at 0 degrees Fahrenheit, while the number after the "W" represents its viscosity at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

Coolant cap brings the boiling point by 3 degrees for every 1 psi of pressure. The cap is designed to release pressure when it exceeds a certain level, preventing damage to the cooling system.

Ignition coil brings the system voltage up to 40,000 volts to create a spark at the spark plug. The ignition coil is responsible for converting the low voltage from the battery into the high voltage needed to ignite the air/fuel mixture in the engine.

Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor measures the amount of air entering the engine and sends this information to the ECM/ECU. This allows the engine control module to adjust the fuel injection and ignition timing for optimal performance.

The compression test is used to measure the pressure in each cylinder during the compression stroke. It helps to identify issues such as worn piston rings, leaking valves, or a blown head gasket. A low compression reading can indicate a problem with the engine's internal components.

Do a leak down test to check for leaks in the engine's cylinders. This test involves pressurizing each cylinder and measuring the amount of air that escapes over time. It can help to identify issues such as worn piston rings, leaking valves, or a blown head gasket.
Cylinder leakage test is used to measure the amount of air that escapes from each cylinder when pressurized. It helps to identify issues such as worn piston rings, leaking valves, or a blown head gasket.

Compression rings per cylinder are typically 2-3, while oil control rings are usually 1-2. The compression rings help to seal the combustion chamber and prevent blow-by, while the oil control rings help to regulate the amount of oil that enters the combustion chamber.
The oil control rings help to prevent excessive oil consumption and reduce emissions by keeping oil from entering the combustion chamber.

Piston is connected to the connecting rod.
The connecting rod is connected to the cranckshaft.

4 cyclinder has 1 head gasket, while a V6 has 2 head gaskets (one for each bank of cylinders). A V8 engine typically has 2 head gaskets as well.

Oil pump is located in the oil pan.

Push rods move the overhead valves in an overhead valve (OHV) engine. In an overhead cam (OHC) engine, the camshaft is located above the valves and directly actuates them without the need for push rods.

TDC = top dead center - both valves are closes.
BDC = bottom dead center - both valves are open.

Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system is used to remove harmful gases from the crankcase and recirculate them back into the intake manifold for combustion. It helps to reduce emissions and improve engine performance.
The PCV valve regulates the flow of gases from the crankcase to the intake manifold, preventing excessive pressure buildup in the crankcase.

Normal oil pressure at idle is typically between 20-30 psi, while normal oil pressure at operating temperature and crusing speeds is usually between 40-60 psi.

Two types of bules is V belt and serpentine belt. The V belt is a traditional belt with a V-shaped cross-section, while the serpentine belt is a single, continuous belt that drives multiple accessories in the engine. The serpentine belt is more efficient and easier to replace than multiple V belts.
Timing belt and timing chain are used to synchronize the rotation of the crankshaft and camshaft(s) in an engine. The timing belt is a rubber belt with teeth that mesh with gears on the crankshaft and camshaft, while the timing chain is a metal chain that performs the same function. Timing belts typically need to be replaced every 60,000-100,000 miles, while timing chains are designed to last the life of the engine.

The battery should not go below 9.6 volts when cranking. If the voltage drops below this level, it can indicate a weak battery or a problem with the starting system.

The starter cranks the start plate and flywheel to start the engine. The starter motor engages with the flywheel to turn the crankshaft and initiate the combustion process.

Coil on plug is the newest design for ignition systems, where each spark plug has its own ignition coil mounted directly on top of it. This design eliminates the need for spark plug wires and provides a more efficient and reliable ignition system.

Too much air makes the car run lean, while too much fuel makes the car run rich. A lean condition can cause engine damage due to overheating, while a rich condition can lead to poor fuel economy and increased emissions.
