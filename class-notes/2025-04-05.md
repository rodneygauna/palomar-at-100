Liquids do not compress.
When you press the brake pedal, the brake fluid in the master cylinder is forced through the brake lines to the calipers.

## Automative Brakes

There is brake fluid in the master cylinder.
Pressing the brake pedal pushes the brake fluid through the brake lines to the calipers.
The calipers squeeze the brake pads against the rotors, creating friction that slows down the vehicle.
When the brake pedal is released, the calipers retract, allowing the brake pads to separate from the rotors.
The brake fluid is then returned to the master cylinder.
The brake system is designed to be a closed system, meaning that the brake fluid should not leak out.

DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluids are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb moisture from the air.
The difference between DOT 3 and DOT 4 is the boiling point.
DOT 3 has a lower boiling point than DOT 4.
DOT 5 (for hydrolic systems) is silicone-based and does not absorb moisture, but it is not compatible with DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluids.

## Brake Bleeding

Bleeding the brakes is the process of removing air from the brake lines.
Air in the brake lines can cause a spongy brake pedal and reduce braking performance.
To bleed the brakes, a brake bleeder tool is used to create a vacuum in the brake lines.
This vacuum pulls the brake fluid through the lines and removes any air bubbles.
The brake bleeder tool is connected to the brake bleeder valve on the caliper.


## Brake Maintenance

Change the brake fluid every 2 years or 30,000 miles, whichever comes first.
Check the brake pads and rotors for wear every 10,000 miles.
Replace the brake pads if they are worn down to 3mm or less.
Replace the rotors if they are warped or have deep grooves.
Check the brake lines for leaks and corrosion every 10,000 miles.
Replace the brake lines if they are leaking or corroded.

## Fade Resistance

Brake operation is a process of changing kinetic energy into thermal energy through the application of friction.
When brakes reach its heat dissipation limit brake fade sets in.

Fade resistance is the ability of the brake system to maintain braking performance under high temperatures.
When the brakes are applied, the friction between the brake pads and rotors generates heat.
If the temperature gets too high, the brake pads can lose their effectiveness, leading to brake fade.
To improve fade resistance, use high-performance brake pads and rotors.
High-performance brake pads are made from materials that can withstand higher temperatures without losing effectiveness.
High-performance rotors are designed to dissipate heat more effectively than standard rotors.

Cooling fans increase the airflow over the brakes, helping to dissipate heat.

## Brake Pads

Brake pads are made from a variety of materials, including organic, semi-metallic, and ceramic.
Organic brake pads are made from materials like rubber, glass, and Kevlar.
They are quiet and produce less dust, but they wear out faster than other types of pads.
Semi-metallic brake pads are made from a mixture of metal fibers and other materials.
They are more durable than organic pads and provide better stopping power, but they can be noisy and produce more dust.
Ceramic brake pads are made from a mixture of ceramic fibers and other materials.
They are quiet, produce less dust, and have a longer lifespan than other types of pads.
However, they can be more expensive than other types of pads.
When choosing brake pads, consider the type of driving you do and your budget.

A disc brake rotor is a flat, circular metal disc that is attached to the wheel hub.
When the brake pads are squeezed against the rotor, they create friction that slows down the vehicle.
A drum brake rotor is a cylindrical metal drum that is attached to the wheel hub.
When the brake shoes are pressed against the drum, they create friction that slows down the vehicle.
Drum brakes are less common than disc brakes and are typically found on the rear wheels of older vehicles.

## Disc Brake Self-Adjustment

When the brakes are applied the caliper piston moves out far enough to apply the braking force from the pads to the rotors.
When they release the caliper only moves far enough to release pressure.
The caliper piston is designed to self-adjust to maintain the proper distance between the brake pads and rotors.

The square cut seal in the caliper piston is designed to create a seal that prevents brake fluid from leaking out of the caliper.
When the brake pedal is released, the square cut seal creates a vacuum that pulls the caliper piston back into the caliper.
This self-adjustment feature helps to maintain the proper distance between the brake pads and rotors, ensuring consistent braking performance.

## Fixed Rotors

When the wheel hub and rotor assembly are cast together, this is commonly known as a one piece rotor and can be classified as a fixed rotor design.
The rotor holds the wheel hub in place and is not designed to be removed or replaced separately.

## Floating Rotors

A rotor that is cast as a separate part and fastened to the hub is called a floating rotor.
An advantage of a floating rotor is that it can be replaced without having to replace the entire wheel hub assembly.
The wheel holds the rotor in place and allows it to float slightly, which helps to reduce vibration and improve braking performance.

## Solid and Ventilated Rotors

Solid rotor is a piece of metal with friction surface on each side.
A solid rotor is usually used on rear brakes on small cars.
A ventilated rotor has cooling fins cast between the braking surface to increase the cooling area of the rotor.

## Caliper Types

Fixed calipers are mounted to the wheel hub and do not move. There are pistons on both sides of the rotor that squeeze the brake pads against the rotor.
Floating calipers are mounted to the wheel hub and can move slightly to allow for better contact with the brake pads. There is a single piston on one side of the rotor that squeezes the brake pads against the rotor.
Sliding calipers are mounted to the wheel hub and can slide back and forth to allow for better contact with the brake pads. There are pistons on both sides of the rotor that squeeze the brake pads against the rotor.
Sliding calipers are commonly used on rear brakes and are designed to provide better braking performance and reduce noise.

## Disc Brake Troubleshooting

Loud or slight brake squeaking can be an indicatorion of front or rear disc worn brake pads.
If pulling to one side during braking, this can be an indicator of a stuck or seized caliper piston or defective piston seal, loose caliper, or internal caliper hose failure.
If dragging brakes, its stuck or seized caliper piston or defective piston seal.

## Caliper Inspection

- Inspect caliper body for cracks or damage.
- Inspect the piston dust boot for holes or tears.
- Inspect caliper for signs of leakage.
- Remove the piston and inspect for signs of rust or scoring.
- Inpect caliper mounting parts for rust or damage.
