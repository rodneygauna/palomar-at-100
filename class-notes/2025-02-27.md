## Cooling System Maintenance, Service and Operations

V-Belts - shaped like a V and can have 1, 2, 3 different types. Driven by the crankshaft -- power the alternator, water pump, power steering, AC, etc.
Can be multiple betls.
Replace: 4-5 years, 40,000/50,000 miles (or when it brakes).
If it's squealing, it's loose.

Serpentine Belt - drives all of the components.
When replacing, make sure to make the amount of ridges.

## Coolant types

Ethylene glycol: most common used antifreeze/coolant. It's green and provides good prtection regardless of climate. "Danger Poisoness"

Organic acid technology: this coolant is environmentally friendly. It is orange in color and is often referred to as "dex-cool".

In warmer climates, mix 50/50 coolant and water. In colder climates, mix 70/30 coolant and water.

## Coolant System

Combustion can reach up to and above 1000 degrees F
Can melt parts, cooling system removes excess heat.

Normal operating temperature is 180-210 degrees F

## Cooling System Pressure

Allows pressure to rise in cooling system.
1 PSI of pressure increases boiling point about 3.25 degress F
Cap normaly holds between 14-18 PSI

## Expansion Tank

Designed to catch and hold coolant passing from the radiator cap as the coolant expands.

## Water pump

Coolant is thrown outward by centrifugal force, producing suction in the center of the pump housing.
Can be belt or gear driven.

## Coolant Hoses

Replace: 4 years, 40,000 miles
